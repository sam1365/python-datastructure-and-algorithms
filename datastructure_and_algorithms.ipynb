    "# Sata Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a data structure is a data organization and storage format that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data.\n",

    "    Pop, which removes the most recently added element.\n",
